Stochastic (Monte-Carlo) simulation of the of Covid-19 pandemic (of the SARS-CoV-2 virus) on complex networks (contact graphs).
The model falls under the general class of a SEIR compartment models.  
The model is a stochastic interpretation of a Covid-19 model based on [the work of Dr. Alison Hill](https://alhill.shinyapps.io/COVID19seir/).


## Installation
------------------
With:
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Example Usage
-----------------
With
```console
python simulation.py
```
